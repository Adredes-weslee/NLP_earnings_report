    "## Experiential Task 2\n",
    "Publicly traded companies announce earnings four times per year. These quarterly announcements convey significant information to the market about the company's performance as well as expectations about performance in the coming period. While Wall Street often focuses on whether earnings-per-share (EPS) \"meets or beats\" expectations, this metric represents only one data point in the announcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managers supplement announced earnings with a detailed narrative disclosure which provides information helpful for interpreting performance. In this task, we will analyze these narrative disclosures using a few different machine learning approaches. Specifically: \n",
    "\n",
    "- We will apply topic modeling to understand the type of language in earnings announcements. \n",
    "- We will use Lasso regression to evaluate which topics best predict stock returns.\n",
    "- We will train a discrete classifier to understand whether earnings announcements can be used to predict large positive returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task will proceed in four general steps:\n",
    "1. Load the data, pre-process, and extract features needed for our machine learning procedures (20% of grade).\n",
    "2. Apply LDA to the corpus and inspect the top 5 words associated with each topic (30% of grade).\n",
    "3. Use Lasso Regression to evaluate which topics most strongly predict stock returns (25% of grade).\n",
    "4. Use a classifier of your choice to model the extent to which topics or words (your choice) most strongly predict large positive returns (>5% over 3-day period) (25% of grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Prepare the Data\n",
    "In this step, you should do the following:\n",
    "1. Load the dataset using pandas. Confirm there are 12,500 rows.\n",
    "2. Write a function that replaces any financial number with \"financial_number.\" Then the function should filter out \"bad\" sentences, defined as those with fewer than 5 tokens OR more than 50% financial numbers. \n",
    "3. Generate a document term matrix which allows for single words and bigrams. Restrict tokens to only those that are all letters (\"alpha\") and at least 3 characters, but make sure to allow for \"financial_number\". Retain the 1,000 most common features, exclude english stop words, and exclude tokens appearing in more than 50% of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 - Load the dataset (ExpTask2Data.csv.gz)\n",
    "Use pandas to load the dataset, \"ExpTask2Data.csv.gz\", into a dataframe. Confirm you have 12,500 rows."

I recommend doing this on a smaller sample of 5,000 records to save time. You should try between 40 and 150 topics, counting by 10s. You should set `topic_word_prior` equal to 0.15 and `doc_topic_prior` to 25 divided by the number of topics. Finally, we will use the coherence score, `u_mass`, as in demo 5A to evaluate topic quality. \n",

    "*My answer:* Based on the diagnostic plot, the best coherence score is the one that is the least negative (i.e. closest to 0). In this case, at 40 topics the mean u_mass is -0.97178, which is higher than (or less negative than) the scores obtained for 50 topics (-0.99891), 60 topics (-1.00951), and the other configurations. Although there is a slight bump around 70 and 80 topics, their scores (around -0.98674 and -0.98274, respectively) are still lower than the score for 40 topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the u_mass coherence measure tends to be more interpretable when it is closer to 0, achieving this value at 40 topics suggests that the model has struck a good balance between granularity and interpretability. In other words, with 40 topics, the model is complex enough to capture the underlying themes in the earnings announcements without overfitting or producing topics that are too fragmented. Therefore, I plan to use 40 topics for the final model, as it provides the best trade-off between coherence and detail based on the data."

    "**QUESTION**: Do you find this answer intuitive? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "*INSERT ANSWER HERE*: Yes, I find the answer intuitive. The Lasso regression highlights two topics with distinct financial language that aligns with how investors react to earnings announcements. For example, Topic 25 contains words like \"eps,\" \"billion,\" and \"financial_number,\" which are generally associated with robust earnings figures and overall positive financial performance. This kind of language is typically interpreted as a sign of strong earnings, which would be expected to drive positive abnormal returns. On the other hand, Topic 3 is dominated by terms such as \"income loss,\" \"net loss,\" \"ebitda,\" and \"adjusted ebitda,\" which clearly signal negative financial performance. Announcements with these terms are likely to be met with negative market reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the fact that Lasso regression identifies these topics as having the strongest associations with BHAR0_2 (buy-and-hold abnormal returns) is consistent with financial intuition—positive performance indicators predict positive returns, while indicators of losses predict negative returns."

    "### Step 4: Use a classifier to predict large positive returns\n",
    "The final part of this task is to use a classifier of your choice to predict large positive returns. You can use the document-term matrix or topic-matrix. You're also free to tune the model as you wish. Training classifiers can be time consuming, so I'm going to use an approach to this section called *specification grading*, meaning you can choose to omit parts of the process for a reduced grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading for this part will be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up, train, and evaluate at least one classifier: If this portion is done perfectly and nothing else is done, you'll receive 50% credit for this part.\n",
    "2. Apply robust tuning procedures to one or more models: If you tune multiple hyperparameters for the one model you fit in step 1, you'll receive an additional 10-20% (max grade 70%) credit, depending on extent of tuning. If you tune two or more models properly, this scale increases to 20-40% (max grade 90%).\n",
    "3. Finally, the last 10% will be based on your best fit model. Specifically, using the validation data set up below, you should print your classification report. The best macro-F1 score in the class will receive 10% (100% cumulative) second best 9.5%, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 - Data set-up and single model training\n",
    "I'll help you set up the data so we all start from the same place. Note that I'm going to set up two sets of \"X\" data, one based on the DTM and the other on the topic matrix. You can use either (or both if you consider multiple models):"
