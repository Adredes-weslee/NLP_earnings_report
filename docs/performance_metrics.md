# NLP Earnings Report Analysis: Performance Metrics

## Overview

This document details the performance metrics and experimental results for the NLP Earnings Report Analysis project. It provides quantitative evaluation of the various models and techniques implemented.

## Topic Modeling Performance

### LDA Topic Model

The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model was evaluated using coherence scores:

| Number of Topics | Coherence Score (c_v) |
|------------------|------------------------|
| 10               | 0.423                  |
| 20               | 0.456                  |
| 30               | 0.481                  |
| **40**           | **0.495**              |
| 50               | 0.477                  |
| 60               | 0.462                  |

**Finding**: The optimal number of topics was determined to be 40, based on maximizing the coherence score.

### BERTopic Model

When using the BERTopic approach with transformer embeddings:

| Configuration                   | Number of Topics | Coherence Score |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Default parameters              | 27               | 0.584           |
| Increased min_cluster_size (15) | 22               | 0.612           |
| Custom embeddings (FinBERT)     | 25               | 0.647           |

**Finding**: BERTopic provided more coherent topics than traditional LDA, with coherence scores improved by approximately 30%.

### Topic Analysis

| 18       | guidance, outlook, forecast, expect, quarter           | +0.109                   | 0.021   |
| 36       | customers, services, solutions, client, platform       | +0.087                   | 0.074   |

**Finding**: Topics related to strong financial performance (EPS, net income) and product growth show positive correlation with returns, while topics related to losses and expenses show negative correlation.

## Conclusion

The performance metrics demonstrate that the combination of topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and feature extraction provides valuable insights into earnings reports. The predictive power is modest but statistically significant, with a Random Forest classifier achieving the best performance. Topic 25 (related to EPS and earnings) emerged as the most predictive feature across multiple analyses, consistent with financial theory that emphasizes the importance of earnings surprises for short-term stock movements.
